Our vision is to be our customers' preferred choice for sustainable construction solutions and this means thinking long-term economically, environmentally and socially. Economically, it means investing in more sustainable products which provide returns over the long-term, reducing costs both for us and our customers while improving our efficiency. Environmentally, it means that we reduce the impact on our surroundings and in turn ensure that our solutions reduce impact in use and production. Socially, it means ensuring that everyone who works with, or for, Tarmac is safe. It is ensuring that we work in harmony with the communities in which we operate and, that as a large business we play our part in the training of the younger generation by taking on apprentices. To help us in our goal to be truly sustainable, we have developed a sustainability framework and have appointed an independent group of external sustainability experts â€“ a Sustainability Panel. For further information about our approach, please see our Sustainability Pages (https://www.tarmac.com/sustainability/)."
